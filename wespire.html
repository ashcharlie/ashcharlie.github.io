										<h2>Gamification of Actions</h2>
										<h4>Emphasizing interactiveness to increase user engagement in company initiatives</h4>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/wespire01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>As WeSpire’s user base expanded it faced the challenge of finding additional innovative ways to keep users engaged with the platform. Despite users’ healthy initial engagement in completing actions within a campaign, there was a noticeable dropoff on subsequent campaigns.</p>
									<p>The platform initially offered points for completing actions but the points were arbitrarily distributed and had no impact outside of an instant gratification. Speaking with existing users led us to conclude that the initial rush from getting points quickly tapered off once those points were seen as irrelevant to any further progress.</p>
									<p>To solve this problem, we quickly hypothesized that by gamifying the platform and allowing points to have an impact on future endeavors then users would remain engaged within the platform at a higher rate. The first step we undertook was to redesign the main page of a campaign to emphasize the point accrual as a primary goal of users. We added campaign progress bars, offered reward badges, and more prominently placed leaderboards to again emphasize the point narrative of campaigns that we wanted to showcase. In addition to updating the campaign page design, we created a new leaderboard page and placed a linked widget prominently on the dashboard for a user to see when they logged in. By showcasing top performers and how a user stacks up against their peers, we again wanted to reinforce the competitive aspect of the platform.elit. Pellentesque enim turpis, hendrerit tristique lorem ipsum dolor.</p>
									<p>By gamifying the campaigns to rebrand the competitive nature within companies and offering rewards for campaign completion, we reduced the dropoff rate by more than 60% for subsequent campaigns. This crucially showed clients that rolling out a longer series of campaigns, and in turn signing a longer contract with the company, would directly be beneficial to achieving their internal employment engagement goals.</p>

										<h2>User-centric Campaign Creation</h2>
										<h4>Shifting the process of creating and launching new engagement campaigns<br>from the customer success team to the customer.</h4>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/wespire01.gif" alt="" /></span>
									<p>WeSpire’s small customer success team was getting overloaded with requests from clients for new campaigns, each of which needed to be custom made by a team member. Not only was it inefficient time allocation, but as the client number grew this process was not scalable. To remedy this we decided the ultimate solution was to put the campaign-creation process in the client’s hands and allow them the freedom to create a campaign on their own. My task was to design a methodology that would allow users full functionality of the creation process and limit the need for assistance from the customer success team.</p>
									<p>After conducting extensive user research with existing clients to determine the level of complexity an entry user could reasonably handle and the minimum requirements needed, I was tasked with designing a process to execute these tasks. Workshopping various methods let me determine the best solution was to use a wizard format which would allow users to see a clear progression, control their own pacing, and save their work.</p>
									<p>After creating some basic wireframes to get a sense of the pacing and included info of each step of the wizard, I created high-fidelity Sketch designs that once completed were put into Invision. This clickable prototype was used to conduct user testing with the existing users. Members of the customer success team watched and took notes as I guided the user through a series of tasks to get a sense of their comfortability with the new product. The information we collected was used to iterate on the designs until the users consistently performed the tasks in the testing accurately and to completion.</p>
									<p>The new wizard format cut down the time customer success team was spending on custom campaigns by 60%, which allowed them to clear up bandwidth for more pressing issues and spend more time focusing on strengthening relationships with clients.</p>

										<h2>Multi-module Integration</h2>
										<h4>Seamlessly combining the existing mobile platform with a new conceptual module<br>to help showcase the company trajectory</h4>
									</header>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/platform-integration-mockups2.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>WeSpire's research and development team had been working on a new module to assist with employee coaching that would allow managers to more accurately and effectively communicate with their team members. I was tasked with mocking up mobile designs of this future platform including how an integration of this module with the current software may look and function that she could present both to investors and to potential clients and partners.</p>
									<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/platform-integration-sketches.png" alt="" /></span> --><p><span class="image right wide"><img src="images/platform-integration-sketches.png" alt="" /></span>After working with the R&amp;D team to gain a better understanding of the new platform, I began sketching out a basic architecture of how the mobile platform may function and designs of what an integration with the existing platform could look like. Knowing that the goal of this was to show how it may integrate with the current site, I used WeSpire's style guide as a directive to the look and feel of what I was mocking up. After iterating on various wireframes with guidance from R&amp;D, I had enough information to create a high-fidelity mockup and, in turn, create a basic, clickable prototype. With implementation of the new platform still being a future endeavour, a fully functioning prototype was deemed unnecessary and the clickable version would suffice for the presentations.</p>
									<p>The mockups helped guide the decision making of the R&amp;D team in their thinking of how a platform integration would function and helped our CEO secure both an additional round of funding and advancements on partnerships. Although due to a number of unforeseeable reasons the project had to be put on hiatus, the mockups are still used in showcasing possible directions for the platform.</p>
