                <h3>THE CHALLENGE:</h3>
                <p>In order to present my work in a clear, personalized manner to viewers, it was necessary to build a site to host my portfolio pieces. There were three methods to accomplishing this:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Host my work on a pre-built portfolio site, such as Behance or Dribbble;</li>
                    <li> Creating my own site, but use a pre-made template such as Wordpress or Squarespace; or</li>
                    <li> Build a website to host my portfolio from scratch.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Wanting to use this as a channel to not only display pieces I’ve produced, but also to demonstrate my abilities, I opted to create my portfolio from scratch.</p>
                <h3>THE SCOPE:</h3>
                <p>Solo effort, comprising all aspects of front-end design and development.</p>
                <h3>UX/UI SKILLS USED:</h3>
                <p>Website Design, Visual Design, Front-end Development, Information Architecture, Wireframing.</p>
                <h3>TOOLS USED:</h3>
                <p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> (HTML5, CSS3), <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>, <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>, <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, pen and paper.</p>

                    <img src="assets/img/portfolio-landing-page-and-logo-sketch.jpg" alt="Portfolio Landing Page Sketch" class="img-responsive">
                    <figcaption>Initial Landing Page and Logo Sketches</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>                
                <h3>THE PROCESS:</h3>
                <p>The first step to completing this process was to establish what I wanted to convey through the design with what I could feasibly accomplish building a site from scratch. I began by sketching some potential designs and information architecture layouts, using my personal experience of navigating websites to maximize creativity yet maintain a clear, intuitive flow.</p>
                <p>I knew that I wanted a crisp, minimalistic appearance to the landing page and to have the page’s emphasis be on my personal logo; the immediate takeaway should be that this is a portfolio of someone—namely Charlie Ash—who focuses on UX- and UI-design, and instinctively know by viewing this landing page what sort of designing they might expect from me.</p>
                <P>The rest of the homepage—the About Me, Portfolio, Contact, etc.—sections should also reflect my style, but convey what a more typically “professional” appearance might be. Clear sans-serif fonts in front of a primarily-solid background, allowing for a clean, easy viewing and reading experience. It was also important to distinguish each page that was a level or more below the homepage as maintaining a consistent brand that reflected the same feeling as the homepage.</p>
                <p>To bridge the gap between creativity and complexity, and allow myself to explore some more complex ideas, I used a Bootstrap framework which I then modified to achieve my desired goal. It allowed for some more advanced features (for example, a parallax effect) that I had not yet learned to code from scratch, but still allowed me to improve my HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript skills.</p>
                <figure class="left">
                    <div class="Portfolio-Wireframe-Sketch">
                    <img src="assets/img/portfolio-wireframe-and-ia-sketch.jpg" alt="Portfolio Wireframe Sketch" class="img-responsive">
                    <figcaption>Portfolio Wireframe and Information Architecture Outlines</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>
                <p>Once we understood the proper methodology, we began to design the solution. The Back-end Developer on our team began building the Google Chrome extension and a Rails server to capture the user data, and I began prototyping potential extension download pages and output pages. I wanted to maintain the Janeiro Digital brand while also, per their instructions, keeping in mind that this was a spin-off project that should infuse some external creativity.</p>
                <p>As is typical with my process, I started with pen-and-paper, constructing wireframes of webpages as well as sketching branding and logo ideas. Once I established a fundamental understanding of what I hoped to accomplish I proceeded to turn the sketched wireframes into mockups using Balsamiq, and expand on the visual design elements in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. This process consisted of many iterations, each time gathering feedback from both my team and the client.</p>

                    </div>
                </figure> -->
                <h3>THE SOLUTION:</h3>
                <p>The produced portfolio, as it is seen currently, is likely the first iteration in what I hope to be a successful and fulfilling career in web design. The design invokes the process which many of my projects reflect: a clear, concise design, beginning with pen wireframing on graph paper and with minimal “flair,” but enough creativity to create a unique brand for each product. This version of the portfolio compromises my early work in wireframing, prototyping, visual design, branding, typography, front-end development, and information architecture. As my skills grow and become more refined, I hope to add pieces that reflect my increased abilities and creative expansion.</p>
